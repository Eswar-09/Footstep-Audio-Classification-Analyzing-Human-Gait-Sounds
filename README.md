## Introduction
In this project, we explore the analysis of human gait sounds using audio processing techniques. The main goal is to classify footstep sounds based on their distinctive features. By extracting relevant audio features and training a machine learning model, we can identify different footstep patterns and distinguish between different classes of footstep sounds.
